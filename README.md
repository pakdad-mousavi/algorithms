# Algorithms

An interactive, fully client-side web app for visualizing core Operating System algorithms, from CPU scheduling to memory management, virtual memory, deadlock handling, and a lot of other algorithms.

Whether you're studying for an exam or just curious about how these foundational algorithms work behind the scenes, this project helps you explore each one through animated, step-by-step visualizations.

## ðŸ”§ Built With

- [Vue 3 (Composition API)](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for clean, responsive design
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and build performance

## ðŸ§  What This Project Offers

### Algorithm Walkthroughs
Every algorithm includes a brief overview of:
- What problem it's solving  
- How it works conceptually  
- A step-by-step breakdown of execution on user-defined input

### Interactive Inputs
Youâ€™re not locked to pre-filled examples. Change process data, resource matrices, memory sizes, and instantly see the results reflected in the visualization.

### Clear, Modern UI
Built to be intuitive for learners, with a clear step-by-step illustration on how the algorithm runs.
